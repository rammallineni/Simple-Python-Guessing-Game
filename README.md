# Simple Python Guessing Game
 This repository contains a simple Python-based number guessing game. The program generates a random digit between 0 and 9, and the player has three chances to guess it. With each guess, the program provides immediate feedback, congratulating the player if they guess correctly or informing them of their loss if they run out of attempts.
